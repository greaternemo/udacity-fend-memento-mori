# udacity-fend-memento-mori
The memory game I made for the second project of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course.

My game, "Memento Mori", is a simple implementation of the card game "Concentration", or "Memory" for literally everyone that hasn't studied card games.
Specifically, "Memento Mori" is a Latin phrase that translates to "remember that you have to die" or "remember that you will die". It refers to the use of the iconography of death, not just as a reminder of mortality but also as a reminder of the impermanence of the physical world by proxy. Symbols used in this way are meant to discourage vanity and encourage self-reflection, among other things.
