# Memento Mori

The memory game I made for the second project of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course.

### Dependencies

The intended experience uses the [Special Elite font](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Special+Elite) from Google Fonts, but it will default to another cursive font if the font fails to load.

The intended experience also expects a display with a minimum width of 320px and looks best with at least 400px width and ~500px height.

There are no other dependencies.

### Installation

Clone the GitHub repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:greaternemo/udacity-fend-memento-mori.git
```
At this point you can rename the directory to whatever you want to use for the URL. The included .htaccess file should work with any URL. 

For example, I have the game installed in my server's `/public_html/memento-mori` directory, so I'm able to load the game after installation just by visiting http://mivida.juegos/memento-mori .

### Background

My game, "Memento Mori", is a simple implementation of the card game "Concentration", or "Memory" for literally everyone that hasn't studied card games.
Specifically, "Memento Mori" is a Latin phrase that translates to "remember that you have to die" or "remember that you will die". It refers to the use of the iconography of death, not just as a reminder of mortality but also as a reminder of the impermanence of the physical world by proxy. Symbols used in this way are meant to discourage vanity and encourage self-reflection, among other things.
