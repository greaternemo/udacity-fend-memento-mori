            Yo I know there wasn't a footer in the example,

        I spent probably an hour trying to figure out how to turn the images into links.
        After trying to cram an <img> into an <a> and some other jank, I realized there was
        a WAAAAY easier way to do what I wanted, which was "do a link but don't underline everything"
